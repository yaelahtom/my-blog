Another thing that affects me is burnout, which is honestly something I've been dealing with on and off for a long time. I have a lot of methods for managing it. Mostly I try to do my best to not look at code after 5pm on a workday, and I usually don't look at code at all on weekends.

One thing I have is a confidence that I can jump into a new project or language or framework and learn whatever is necessary and relevant for me to succeed. I live by the mantra of "You don't need to know anything". You'll figure it out when you need to know it. This is not necessarily something that is tested in coding interviews, however.
